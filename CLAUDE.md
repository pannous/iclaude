# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

The Vibe Companion — a web UI for Claude Code. It reverse-engineers the undocumented `--sdk-url` WebSocket protocol in the Claude Code CLI to provide a browser-based interface for running multiple Claude Code sessions with streaming, tool call visibility, and permission control.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Dev server (Hono backend on :3456 + Vite HMR on :2345)
cd web && bun install && bun run dev
# Usually the server is already running so don't kill it just use it it will automatically update!


# Or from repo root
make dev

# Type checking
cd web && bun run typecheck

# Production build + serve
cd web && bun run build && bun run start

# Landing page (thecompanion.sh) — idempotent: starts if down, no-op if up
# IMPORTANT: Always use this script to run the landing page. Never cd into landing/ and run bun/vite manually.
./scripts/landing-start.sh          # start
./scripts/landing-start.sh --stop   # stop
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
cd web && bun run test

# Watch mode
cd web && bun run test:watch
```

- All new backend (`web/server/`) and frontend (`web/src/`) code **must** include tests when possible.
- Tests use Vitest. Server tests live alongside source files (e.g. `routes.test.ts` next to `routes.ts`).
- A husky pre-commit hook runs typecheck and tests automatically before each commit.
- **Never remove or delete existing tests.** If a test is failing, fix the code or the test. If you believe a test should be removed, you must first explain to the user why and get explicit approval before removing it.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Browser (React) ←→ WebSocket ←→ Hono Server (Bun) ←→ WebSocket (NDJSON) ←→ Claude Code CLI
     :2345              /ws/browser/:id        :3456        /ws/cli/:id         (--sdk-url)
```

1. Browser sends a "create session" REST call to the server
2. Server spawns `claude --sdk-url ws://localhost:3456/ws/cli/SESSION_ID` as a subprocess
3. CLI connects back to the server over WebSocket using NDJSON protocol
4. Server bridges messages between CLI WebSocket and browser WebSocket
5. Tool calls arrive as `control_request` (subtype `can_use_tool`) — browser renders approval UI, server relays `control_response` back

### All code lives under `web/`

- **`web/server/`** — Hono + Bun backend (runs on port 3456)
  - `index.ts` — Server bootstrap, Bun.serve with dual WebSocket upgrade (CLI vs browser)
  - `ws-bridge.ts` — Core message router. Maintains per-session state (CLI socket, browser sockets, message history, pending permissions). Parses NDJSON from CLI, translates to typed JSON for browsers.
  - `cli-launcher.ts` — Spawns/kills/relaunches Claude Code CLI processes. Handles `--resume` for session recovery. Persists session state across server restarts.
  - `session-store.ts` — JSON file persistence to `$TMPDIR/vibe-sessions/`. Debounced writes.
  - `session-types.ts` — All TypeScript types for CLI messages (NDJSON), browser messages, session state, permissions.
  - `routes.ts` — REST API: session CRUD, filesystem browsing, environment management.
  - `env-manager.ts` — CRUD for environment profiles stored in `~/.companion/envs/`.

- **`web/src/`** — React 19 frontend
  - `store.ts` — Zustand store. All state keyed by session ID (messages, streaming text, permissions, tasks, connection status).
  - `ws.ts` — Browser WebSocket client. Connects per-session, handles all incoming message types, auto-reconnects. Extracts task items from `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TodoWrite` tool calls.
  - `types.ts` — Re-exports server types + client-only types (`ChatMessage`, `TaskItem`, `SdkSessionInfo`).
  - `api.ts` — REST client for session management.
  - `App.tsx` — Root layout with sidebar, chat view, task panel. Hash routing (`#/playground`).
  - `components/` — UI: `ChatView`, `MessageFeed`, `MessageBubble`, `ToolBlock`, `Composer`, `Sidebar`, `TopBar`, `HomePage`, `TaskPanel`, `PermissionBanner`, `EnvManager`, `Playground`.

- **`web/bin/cli.ts`** — CLI entry point (`bunx the-vibe-companion`). Sets `__VIBE_PACKAGE_ROOT` and imports the server.

### WebSocket Protocol

The CLI uses NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON). Key message types from CLI: `system` (init/status), `assistant`, `result`, `stream_event`, `control_request`, `tool_progress`, `tool_use_summary`, `keep_alive`. Messages to CLI: `user`, `control_response`, `control_request` (for interrupt/set_model/set_permission_mode).

Full protocol documentation is in `WEBSOCKET_PROTOCOL_REVERSED.md`.

### Session Lifecycle

Sessions persist to disk (`$TMPDIR/vibe-sessions/`) and survive server restarts. On restart, live CLI processes are detected by PID and given a grace period to reconnect their WebSocket. If they don't, they're killed and relaunched with `--resume` using the CLI's internal session ID.

## Browser Exploration

Always use `agent-browser` CLI command to explore the browser. Never use playwright or other browser automation libraries.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:
- use commitzen to format the commit message and the PR title
- Add a screenshot of the changes in the PR description if its a visual change
- Explain simply what the PR does and why it's needed
- Tell me if the code was reviewed by a human or simply generated directly by an AI. 


## Duplicated commits?
When pulling/merging from upstream check if they duplicate a functionality which we already have. 
Make sure to not lose our own commits! 

## Additions
While Claude runs normally in the background all responses are scanned for additional features especially any HTML fragments will be rendered on-screen. So you Claude now have the ability to send me images!


## Unsafe mode
The conversation automatically picks up images and HTML fragments, which have access to a function 
`window.vibeCommand()` that can send ANY bash command to the backend! This allows for powerful interactions, but also opens up security risks if the content is not trusted. Injected API into HTML iframes when YOLO mode is active.
